### **Where to start in Unit 16 (Strings)**

1. **16.1 Strings in Depth (extension of 05.7)**

   * Memory model of strings with diagrams (ASCII table, how `\0` is stored).
   * Declaring with and without size.
   * Common mistakes (size too small, forgetting `\0`).
   * Iterating through a string (loop, indexing).
   * Examples: Print each char separately, count length manually.

2. **16.2 Character Arrays vs String Literals**

   * `char name[] = "Neel";` vs `char *name = "Neel";`
   * Why the first is mutable but second is not.
   * Demo showing what happens if you try to modify a string literal.

3. **16.3 String Input/Output**

   * `scanf("%s", str)` and its problem with spaces.
   * Why `gets()` is unsafe.
   * Using `fgets()` safely.
   * Using `puts()` for quick output.
   * Small interactive examples.

4. **16.4 String Handling Functions (string.h)**

   * `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strcmp`.
   * Each explained with examples, step-by-step tracing.
   * Pitfalls (buffer overflow, modifying after `strcpy`, etc.).
