## 1. Introduction to C Language

### Definition
C is a general-purpose, structured programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s at Bell Labs. It is widely used for system programming (like operating systems) and application development due to its efficiency, flexibility, and control over computer hardware.

### Why Learn C?
- **Foundation for Other Languages**: Many modern languages like C++, Java, and Python are influenced by C.
- **Close to Hardware**: C allows direct manipulation of hardware, making it ideal for operating systems and embedded systems.
- **Fast and Efficient**: C programs run quickly because they are compiled into machine code.

### Real-World Example
C is used in:
- Operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Embedded systems in devices like washing machines, microwave ovens, and car dashboards.
- Game development for creating fast and efficient game engines.

## 2. Compiler vs Interpreter

### Definition
- **Compiler**: A compiler translates the entire C program (source code) into machine code (executable file) at once. If there are errors, it reports them all after scanning the whole program.
- **Interpreter**: An interpreter executes the program line by line without creating an executable file. It stops at the first error it encounters.

### Differences
| Feature              | Compiler                            | Interpreter                        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Execution            | Translates entire code at once      | Executes code line by line         |
| Speed                | Faster (once compiled)              | Slower (interprets each line)      |
| Error Reporting      | Shows all errors after compilation  | Stops at the first error           |
| Output               | Creates an executable file          | No executable file                 |
| Example Languages    | C, C++                              | Python, JavaScript                 |

### Real-World Example
- **Compiler**: When you install software like a game, the C code is compiled into an `.exe` file that runs on your computer.
- **Interpreter**: When you run a Python script in a tool like Jupyter Notebook, it executes line by line, showing results instantly.

### C Example
C uses a compiler (e.g., GCC). You write a program, compile it, and run the executable:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
- Save as `hello.c`, compile with `gcc hello.c -o hello`, and run with `./hello`.

## 3. Identifiers

### Definition
Identifiers are names given to variables, functions, or other user-defined items in a C program. They are used to identify elements in the code.

### Rules for Identifiers
1. Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
2. Can contain letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.
3. Cannot use keywords (like `int`, `if`) as identifiers.
4. Case-sensitive (e.g., `age` and `Age` are different).
5. No spaces or special characters (except underscore).

### Examples
- Valid: `studentName`, `_count`, `total_marks`
- Invalid: `2ndPlace`, `total$`, `if` (keyword)

### Real-World Example
In a student management system, identifiers like `studentID`, `totalMarks`, and `grade` are used to store and manage student data.

### C Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int studentAge = 20; // studentAge is an identifier
    printf("Student's age: %d\n", studentAge);
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 4. Data Types

### Definition
Data types specify the type of data a variable can hold, such as numbers, characters, or decimals. They determine the size and type of values stored.

### Basic Data Types in C
| Data Type    | Description                     | Size (bytes) | Example Values         |
|--------------|---------------------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| `int`        | Integer numbers                 | 2 or 4       | 5, -10, 0              |
| `float`      | Single-precision floating-point | 4            | 3.14, -0.5             |
| `double`     | Double-precision floating-point | 8            | 3.14159, 2.71828       |
| `char`       | Single character                | 1            | 'A', 'b', '1'          |

### Real-World Example
- `int`: Used to store a student’s roll number (e.g., 101).
- `float`: Used to store a student’s percentage (e.g., 85.5).
- `char`: Used to store a student’s grade (e.g., 'A').

### C Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int rollNo = 101;
    float percentage = 85.5;
    char grade = 'A';
    printf("Roll No: %d, Percentage: %.2f, Grade: %c\n", rollNo, percentage, grade);
    return 0;
}
```

## 5. Input and Output

### Definition
- **Input**: Taking data from the user (e.g., via keyboard) using functions like `scanf()`.
- **Output**: Displaying data to the user (e.g., on the screen) using functions like `printf()`.

### Common Functions
- `printf()`: Prints formatted output to the console.
  - Format specifiers: `%d` (int), `%f` (float), `%c` (char), `%s` (string).
- `scanf()`: Reads input from the user.
  - Requires the address of the variable (using `&`).

### Real-World Example
In a calculator app, `scanf()` takes numbers from the user, and `printf()` displays the result.

### C Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int age;
    float height;
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);
    printf("Enter your height (in meters): ");
    scanf("%f", &height);
    printf("You are %d years old and %.2f meters tall.\n", age, height);
    return 0;
}
```

## 6. Type Conversion & Type Casting

### Definition
- **Type Conversion**: Automatically converting one data type to another (e.g., `int` to `float`) during operations.
- **Type Casting**: Explicitly converting one data type to another using a cast operator.

### Type Conversion
Happens automatically when different data types are used in an expression. The smaller data type is converted to the larger one (e.g., `int` to `float`).

### Type Casting
Manually converting a value using `(type)` before the value.

### Real-World Example
In a billing system, if you calculate the average price of items (float), but the final bill is displayed as an integer, you use type casting to convert `float` to `int`.

### C Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    // Type Conversion (Automatic)
    int a = 5;
    float b = 2.5;
    float result = a + b; // int a is converted to float
    printf("Type Conversion: %f\n", result); // Output: 7.500000

    // Type Casting (Manual)
    float price = 99.99;
    int roundedPrice = (int)price; // Cast float to int
    printf("Type Casting: %d\n", roundedPrice); // Output: 99
    return 0;
}
```

## 7. Arithmetic Operators

### Definition
Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations on variables or values.

### Common Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Description            | Example         |
|----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| `+`      | Addition               | `5 + 3 = 8`    |
| `-`      | Subtraction            | `5 - 3 = 2`    |
| `*`      | Multiplication         | `5 * 3 = 15`   |
| `/`      | Division               | `6 / 2 = 3`    |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder)    | `7 % 2 = 1`    |

### Real-World Example
In a shopping app, `+` is used to calculate the total price, and `%` is used to check if a number is even or odd for discounts (e.g., buy 2, get 1 free).

### C Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 3;
    printf("Addition: %d\n", a + b); // 13
    printf("Subtraction: %d\n", a - b); // 7
    printf("Multiplication: %d\n", a * b); // 30
    printf("Division: %d\n", a / b); // 3
    printf("Modulus: %d\n", a % b); // 1
    return 0;
}
```

## 8. Logical AND and Logical OR

### Definition
Logical operators are used to combine conditions or make decisions in a program.
- **Logical AND (`&&`)**: Returns `true` if both conditions are true.
- **Logical OR (`||`)**: Returns `true` if at least one condition is true.

### Truth Tables
**Logical AND (`&&`)**
| A     | B     | A && B |
|-------|-------|--------|
| True  | True  | True   |
| True  | False | False  |
| False | True  | False  |
| False | False | False  |

**Logical OR (`||`)**
| A     | B     | A && B |
|-------|-------|--------|
| True  | True  | True   |
| True  | False | True   |
| False | True  | true   |
| False | False | False  |

### Real-World Example
In a login system:
- **AND**: Check if both username and password are correct (`username == "admin" && password == "1234"`).
- **OR**: Allow access if the user is an admin or a guest (`role == "admin" || role == "guest"`).

### C Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int age = 20;
    int marks = 85;
    
    // Logical AND
    if (age >= 18 && marks >= 80) {
        printf("Eligible for scholarship (AND condition).\n");
    }
    
    // Logical OR
    if (age >= 18 || marks >= 90) {
        printf("Eligible for admission (OR condition).\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

## 9. If, Else If, Else Statements

### Definition
The `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements are control structures in C that allow a program to make decisions based on conditions. They control the flow of execution by executing different blocks of code depending on whether specific conditions are true or false.

### Detailed Explanation
- **if**: Evaluates a condition inside parentheses. If the condition is true (non-zero in C), the code block inside `{}` is executed. If false (zero), the block is skipped.
- **else if**: Used to check additional conditions if the previous `if` or `else if` conditions are false. It allows testing multiple conditions sequentially.
- **else**: A fallback block that executes if none of the previous `if` or `else if` conditions are true. It is optional and does not take a condition.
- Conditions are typically expressions that evaluate to true (non-zero) or false (zero), often using comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) or logical operators (`&&`, `||`).

### Syntax
```c
if (condition1) {
    // Code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code to execute if condition2 is true
} else if (condition3) {
    // Code to execute if condition3 is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if all conditions are false
}
```

### Key Points
- Only one block (either `if`, one of the `else if`, or `else`) is executed. Once a condition is true, the rest are skipped.
- The `else if` and `else` parts are optional. You can use just `if` alone or `if` with `else`.
- Conditions must be enclosed in parentheses `()`.
- Nested `if` statements (if inside another if) can be used for complex decision-making.

### Real-World Example
In a grading system:
- If a student’s marks are >= 90, assign grade 'A'.
- Else if marks are >= 75, assign grade 'B'.
- Else if marks are >= 60, assign grade 'C'.
- Else, assign grade 'F'.
This system evaluates a student’s performance and assigns a grade based on their marks.

### C Example 1: Simple Grading System
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int marks;
    printf("Enter your marks: ");
    scanf("%d", &marks);
    
    if (marks >= 90) {
        printf("Grade: A\n");
    } else if (marks >= 75) {
        printf("Grade: B\n");
    } else if (marks >= 60) {
        printf("Grade: C\n");
    } else {
        printf("Grade: F\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
**Explanation**:
- The program prompts the user to enter their marks.
- It checks if `marks >= 90` for grade 'A'.
- If false, it checks `marks >= 75` for grade 'B'.
- If false, it checks `marks >= 60` for grade 'C'.
- If none are true, it assigns grade 'F'.

### C Example 2: Traffic Light System
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char light;
    printf("Enter traffic light color (R/G/Y): ");
    scanf(" %c", &light);
    
    if (light == 'R' || light == 'r') {
        printf("Stop\n");
    } else if (light == 'G' || light == 'g') {
        printf("Go\n");
    } else if (light == 'Y' || light == 'y') {
        printf("Slow down\n");
    } else {
        printf("Invalid color\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
**Explanation**:
- The program takes a character input for the traffic light color.
- It checks if the input is 'R' or 'r' to display "Stop".
- If not, it checks for 'G' or 'g' to display "Go".
- If not, it checks for 'Y' or 'y' to display "Slow down".
- If none match, it displays "Invalid color".
- Logical OR (`||`) is used to handle both uppercase and lowercase inputs.

### C Example 3: Nested If for Age and Height Check
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int age;
    float height;
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);
    printf("Enter your height (in meters): ");
    scanf("%f", &height);
    
    if (age >= 18) {
        if (height >= 1.7) {
            printf("You are eligible for the basketball team.\n");
        } else {
            printf("You are too short for the basketball team.\n");
        }
    } else {
        printf("You are too young for the basketball team.\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
**Explanation**:
- This program checks if a person is eligible for a basketball team.
- The outer `if` checks if `age >= 18`.
- If true, a nested `if` checks if `height >= 1.7` to determine eligibility.
- If the age condition is false, it skips the height check and prints a message.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Forgetting Braces**: If you omit `{}` for a multi-statement block, only the first statement is considered part of the `if` or `else`.
   ```c
   if (marks >= 90)
       printf("Grade: A\n");
       printf("Congratulations!\n"); // This will always execute
   ```
   Fix: Use braces to group statements.
2. **Using `=` instead of `==`**: `=` is for assignment, while `==` is for comparison.
   ```c
   if (marks = 90) // Wrong: Assigns 90 to marks
   if (marks == 90) // Correct: Compares marks with 90
   ```
3. **Misplacing Semicolons**: A semicolon after `if` ends the statement prematurely.
   ```c
   if (marks >= 90); // Wrong: Empty if block
   {
       printf("Grade: A\n");
   }
   ```
4. **Overlapping Conditions**: Ensure `else if` conditions don’t overlap, or the first true condition will execute, skipping others.
