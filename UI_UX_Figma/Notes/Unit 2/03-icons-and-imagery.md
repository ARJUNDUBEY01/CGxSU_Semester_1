- Icons must be **simple, bold, and easily recognizable** even at smaller sizes (e.g., 24px).  
- Avoid overly detailed illustrations or thin lines, as they may blur or pixelate on entry-level devices.  
- Example: A thick, minimal "phone" icon is clearer than a detailed sketch of a smartphone.  

#### **2. Performance**
- Heavy image files lead to **long loading times**, especially on **2G/3G or unstable networks**.  
- Use **lightweight formats** like **SVG for icons** (scales without losing quality) and **compressed JPG/WEBP for photos**.  
- Optimize file sizes to stay under **100KB for images** whenever possible.  
- Example: A banner in JPG/WEBP loads faster and saves data compared to a high-res PNG.  

#### **3. Cultural Fit**
- Icons and images should reflect **local contexts** to build trust and familiarity.  
- Replace **global references ($, Western meals, taxis)** with **local ones (₹, Indian thali, auto-rickshaw)**.  
- Use photos and illustrations that represent **diverse Indian culture, clothing, and environments**.  
- Example: A “food delivery” app showing a **roti with curry** feels more relatable than a hamburger image.  


#### **4. Accessibility**
- Many small-town users have **older devices** with dim screens or limited eyesight.  
- Use **clear outlines, bold shapes, and strong contrast** for better visibility.  
- Avoid using color alone to differentiate icons (e.g., red vs green), as it excludes **colorblind users**.  
- Example: A success icon should be a **checkmark + green color**, not just green.  

### **Key Insight**
By designing **lightweight, scalable, culturally relevant, and accessible visuals**, designers can create icons and imagery that **resonate with Indian users**, perform well on budget devices, and remain universally clear.
