## Introduction to HTML 

 # What is HTMl
  - HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
  - HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
  - HTML describes the structure of a Web page
  - HTML consists of a series of elements
  - HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
    
# Structure of HTML Documnet
```bash
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to my page</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  <a href="https://example.com">Click here</a>
</body>
</html>
```

# Basic Structure Tags

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type as HTML5. It must be the first line in an HTML file to ensure proper rendering by browsers.
- `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page, containing all other tags. It typically includes the `lang` attribute (e.g., `lang="en"`) to specify the document's language.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata about the document, such as the page title, character encoding, and links to external resources (e.g., CSS or JavaScript files). Content in this tag is not displayed on the webpage.
- `<meta>`: Provides metadata, such as character set (`charset="UTF-8"`) or viewport settings for responsive design (`name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"`).
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the webpage, displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the webpage, such as text, images, and other elements.

## Text Formatting Tags

- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Define headings, with `<h1>` being the most important (largest) and `<h6>` the least. Used for hierarchical organization of content.
- `<p>`: Defines a paragraph of text.
- `<strong>`: Indicates strong importance, typically displayed as bold text.
- `<br>`: Inserts a line break within text. It is a self-closing tag (no closing tag needed).
- `<hr>`: Creates a horizontal rule (line) to separate content. Also self-closing.

# Closing and Self-Closing HTML Tags

HTML tags are used to structure content on a webpage. They can be categorized based on whether they require a closing tag or are self-closing. This document explains the difference between closing and self-closing tags, with examples of each.

## Closing Tags

Closing tags are HTML tags that require both an opening tag (e.g., `<tag>`) and a closing tag (e.g., `</tag>`) to properly enclose content. These tags are used when the element needs to contain text, other HTML elements, or both. Failing to include a closing tag may cause rendering issues or unexpected behavior in browsers.

### Examples of Tags with Closing Tags
- `<p>`: Defines a paragraph. Content like text or inline elements goes between `<p>` and `</p>`.
  - Example: `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`
- `<div>`: A block-level container for grouping content or applying styles.
  - Example: `<div><h1>Title</h1><p>Content</p></div>`
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Define headings of varying importance.
  - Example: `<h1>Main Heading</h1>`
- `<a>`: Creates a hyperlink, with text or other elements as the link's content.
  - Example: `<a href="https://example.com">Click here</a>`
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`: Used for unordered or ordered lists and their items.
  - Example: `<ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li></ul>`
- `<span>`: An inline container for styling or manipulating small portions of content.
  - Example: `<span style="color: blue;">Blue text</span>`
- `<form>`: Defines a form for user input, containing elements like `<input>` or `<button>`.
  - Example: `<form><input type="text"></form>`
- `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`: Used for tabular data.
  - Example: `<table><tr><th>Header</th></tr><tr><td>Data</td></tr></table>`

## Self-Closing Tags

Self-closing tags, also known as void elements, do not require a separate closing tag because they do not contain content (text or other elements). They are written with a forward slash (`/`) before the closing angle bracket (`>`), though in HTML5, the slash is optional (e.g., `<img>` is equivalent to `<img />`). These tags typically represent elements that insert something into the page, like an image or a line break.

### Examples of Self-Closing Tags
- `<img>`: Embeds an image, using `src` for the image URL and `alt` for accessibility.
  - Example: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">`
- `<br>`: Inserts a line break within text.
  - Example: `<p>First line<br>Second line</p>`
- `<hr>`: Creates a horizontal rule to separate content.
  - Example: `<hr>`
- `<input>`: Defines a form input, such as a text box or button, with attributes like `type` and `name`.
  - Example: `<input type="text" name="username">`
- `<meta>`: Provides metadata, such as character encoding or viewport settings.
  - Example: `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
- `<link>`: Links external resources, like CSS files, using `rel` and `href`.
  - Example: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`
