# **Git & GitHub Assignment – Mode 2: Essential System Commands for Git Users**

## **Objective**

Master the essential terminal commands used alongside Git, with plenty of examples and contexts.

---

## **Section 0 – Getting Help for Any Command**

### **Why?**

Before learning commands, students should know how to get help anytime without searching online.

**Commands:**

* See manual pages:

  ```bash
  man git
  man ls
  ```
* Get short help for Git:

  ```bash
  git help
  git help commit
  ```
* See examples of a command:

  ```bash
  git add --help
  ```
* Quick command usage:

  ```bash
  ls --help
  ```

**Git Context Example:**
If you forget how `git log` works:

```bash
git help log
```

---

## **Section 1 – Navigating the Filesystem**

### **1. `pwd` – Print Working Directory**

Shows your current folder path.

```bash
pwd
```

Git context: Verify you’re inside the repository before running Git commands.

---

### **2. `ls` – List Files**

* List files:

  ```bash
  ls
  ```
* Show hidden files (like `.git`):

  ```bash
  ls -a
  ```
* Show detailed info (permissions, owner, size):

  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```
* Sort by time modified:

  ```bash
  ls -lt
  ```

Git context: Check if `.git` exists and see which files are ready to be committed.

---

### **3. `cd` – Change Directory**

* Move into a folder:

  ```bash
  cd docs
  ```
* Move back one level:

  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```
* Go to home directory:

  ```bash
  cd ~
  ```

Git context: Navigate into the correct project folder before running `git status`.

---

## **Section 2 – Creating and Editing Files**

### **4. `touch` – Create Empty Files**

* Create one file:

  ```bash
  touch README.md
  ```
* Create multiple files:

  ```bash
  touch file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

Git context: Create placeholder files before adding to Git.

---

### **5. `nano` or `vim` – Edit Files in Terminal**

* Open file in nano:

  ```bash
  nano notes.txt
  ```
* Save and exit nano:

  * Press `CTRL + O` → `Enter` → `CTRL + X`

Git context: Quickly edit commit message files when Git opens an editor.

---

### **6. `mkdir` – Create Directories**

* Create one folder:

  ```bash
  mkdir images
  ```
* Create nested folders:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p src/components
  ```

Git context: Organize project structure before committing.

---

## **Section 3 – Removing and Moving Files**

### **7. `rm` – Remove Files**

* Remove a file:

  ```bash
  rm old.txt
  ```
* Remove folder and its contents:

  ```bash
  rm -r old_folder
  ```
* Force remove without prompt:

  ```bash
  rm -rf temp
  ```

Git context: Use `git rm` to remove files from both your repo and Git history.

---

### **8. `mv` – Move or Rename Files**

* Rename file:

  ```bash
  mv oldname.txt newname.txt
  ```
* Move file to folder:

  ```bash
  mv notes.txt docs/
  ```

Git context: If you rename files, Git will track this as a rename.

---

## **Section 4 – File Viewing and Searching**

### **9. `cat` – View File Contents**

```bash
cat README.md
```

Git context: Quickly check file before committing.

---

### **10. `less` – Scroll Through File**

```bash
less bigfile.txt
```

Navigation:

* Up/Down arrows to scroll
* `q` to quit

---

### **11. `grep` – Search Inside Files**

* Search for the word "TODO":

  ```bash
  grep "TODO" *.txt
  ```
* Search recursively in all files:

  ```bash
  grep -r "function" .
  ```

Git context: Find keywords in your code before committing.

---

## **Section 5 – Permissions and Ownership**

### **12. `chmod` – Change File Permissions**

* Make file executable:

  ```bash
  chmod +x script.sh
  ```
* Remove write permission:

  ```bash
  chmod -w file.txt
  ```

Git context: If you commit scripts, ensure correct permissions before pushing.

---

### **13. `chown` – Change File Owner**

```bash
sudo chown user:user file.txt
```

Git context: Useful when cloned files have wrong ownership.

---

## **Section 6 – Admin Commands**

### **14. `sudo` – Run as Superuser**

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

Git context: Needed for installing/updating Git or changing protected files.

---

## **Section 7 – Practice Task**

**Assignment:**

1. Create a folder `mode2-practice`.
2. Inside:

   * Create `README.md` and write “Mode 2 Practice”.
   * Create `docs` folder with two `.txt` files.
   * Rename one file using `mv`.
   * Search for a keyword using `grep`.
   * Make a script executable with `chmod`.
   * Delete one file using `rm`.
3. Initialize Git, commit files, and push to GitHub.
